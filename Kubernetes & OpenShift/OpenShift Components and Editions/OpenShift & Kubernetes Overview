Container
	encapsulated process with all the required dependencies for the program to run
	
		system dependencies come from the kernel and OS
		
		app dependencies are packaged independent of host system dependencies
		
	Advantages
		Modularity
		Portability - app can work equivalently in a container on any host
		Isolate processes into its own runtime environment
			System changes are not inherited by the runtime
		
Kubernetes
	Automate the container management at scale
		organizes app containers into manageable pods
		creates app or tenant isolation via namespace
		provides integration with other components (like CI/CD Jenkins pipelines)
